# 📊 Simple Trading Signal Predictor

**Train ML models to predict stock trading signals and visualize predictions on unseen data.**

---

## 🛠️ About This Project

This project served as a hands-on exploration of setting up **proper Cursor AI workflows** and establishing best practices for AI-assisted development. In addition to building the trading signal predictor, I configured comprehensive Cursor rules and templates to ensure:

- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation between UI, data, core logic, and visualization layers
- **Consistent Coding Standards**: Type hints, docstrings, naming conventions, and code organization
- **Structured Workflows**: Templates for feature planning, code reviews, product briefs, and documentation
- **Development Best Practices**: Testing guidelines, version control conventions, and documentation standards

The Cursor configuration includes:
- Custom rules file (`.cursor/rules/generalrudes.mdc`) defining tech stack, file structure, and coding principles
- Template files for feature planning (`plan_feature.md`), code reviews (`code_review.md`), and product briefs (`product_brief.md`)
- Guidelines for maintaining clean, testable, and maintainable code

This setup enables more efficient AI-assisted development by providing clear context and standards for the AI agent to follow when working on the codebase.

> **⚠️ Important Note**: This project was **not** focused on creating the most accurate ML model possible. Instead, it was an exploration of **spec-driven development** capabilities—testing how effectively one can bootstrap a new project in a domain they're not deeply knowledgeable in by using clear specifications, structured workflows, and AI-assisted development. The ML model serves as a practical example to validate this approach, but optimizing model accuracy was not the primary goal.

## 🎯 What This Does

This is a **simplified machine learning trading signal predictor** that:

1. **Fetches** historical stock data from Yahoo Finance
2. **Calculates** 50+ technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.)
3. **Trains** ML models (XGBoost, Random Forest, or LightGBM)
4. **Predicts** BUY/HOLD/SELL signals
5. **Visualizes** predictions on a price chart, highlighting test data the model has NEVER seen

**Goal:** Test if ML can predict stock movements based on technical indicators.

## 📈 What You'll See

### The Main Chart

**Price chart with predicted signals:**
- **Blue shaded region** = Training data (model learned from this)
- **Green shaded region** = Test data (model NEVER saw this!)
- **Orange line** = Train/test split
- Small faded markers = Training predictions (reference)
- **🎯 Large bold markers** = TEST predictions (what matters!)

### Key Metrics

- **Test Accuracy**: How often the model was correct on unseen data
  - 33% = Random guessing (3 classes)
  - 50%+ = Model is learning patterns ✅
  - 60%+ = Model working well! ✅✅

- **Test Samples**: Number of data points in test set

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Data Collection
Fetches OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data from Yahoo Finance.

### 2. Feature Engineering
Calculates 50+ technical indicators organized into:
- **Trend**: EMAs, SMAs, ADX, Ichimoku
- **Momentum**: RSI, Stochastic, Williams %R, CCI
- **Volatility**: ATR, Bollinger Bands, Keltner Channels
- **Volume**: OBV, VWAP, Volume ratios
- **Price**: Returns, ranges, gaps

### 3. Label Generation
Creates BUY/HOLD/SELL labels based on future price movements:
- **BUY**: Price expected to rise ≥2%
- **HOLD**: Price expected to move <2%
- **SELL**: Price expected to fall ≥2%

### 4. Train/Test Split
Splits data **chronologically** (e.g., 80/20):
- **Training (80%)**: First 80% of data - model learns here
- **Testing (20%)**: Last 20% of data - model tested here
- **Important**: Model NEVER sees test data during training!

### 5. Model Training
Trains one of three ML models:
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting (usually most accurate)
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble of decision trees (stable)
- **LightGBM**: Fast gradient boosting (efficient)

### 6. Prediction
Generates predictions for all data, including the unseen test set.

### 7. Visualization
Displays predictions on price chart with clear train/test distinction.

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Stock Ticker
- Enter any valid stock symbol (e.g., AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT)
- Crypto symbols need suffix (e.g., BTC-USD, ETH-USD)

### Timeframe
- **6M**: 6 months (~126 trading days)
- **1Y**: 1 year (~252 trading days)
- **2Y**: 2 years (~504 trading days) - **Recommended**
- **5Y**: 5 years (~1260 trading days)

### ML Model
- **XGBoost**: Usually most accurate, good default choice
- **Random Forest**: More stable, less prone to overfitting
- **LightGBM**: Fastest, good for experimentation

### Train/Test Split
- **50%**: Half for training, half for testing
- **70%**: More testing data (harder for model)
- **80%**: Balanced (recommended)
- **90%**: More training data (easier for model, less testing)

## 📊 Interpreting Results

### Good Result ✅
```
Test Accuracy: 58%
Test region shows:
- BUY signals near price bottoms
- SELL signals near price tops
- Clear pattern recognition
```
→ Model is learning useful patterns!

### Bad Result ❌
```
Test Accuracy: 35%
Test region shows:
- Random BUY/SELL signals
- No correlation with price movements
```
→ Model is just guessing, stock may not be predictable with technical indicators

### What to Try:
- **Different timeframes**: Longer timeframes often work better
- **Different stocks**: Some stocks are more predictable than others
- **Different models**: XGBoost vs Random Forest vs LightGBM
- **Different splits**: Try 70% or 90% train/test

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Not enough data"
- **Cause**: Ticker too new or timeframe too short
- **Fix**: Try longer timeframe or different ticker

### "Module not found"
- **Cause**: Dependencies not installed
- **Fix**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### "Low test accuracy (~35%)"
- **Cause**: Stock may not be predictable with technical indicators
- **Fix**: Try different stock, timeframe, or model

### Chart not showing signals
- **Cause**: Model predicting mostly HOLD (which doesn't show markers)
- **Fix**: This is okay! HOLD = "no clear signal"
